### 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi there 👋 My name is Natasha.  
I'm a web development learner passionate about building clean and accessible interfaces.  
Right now I'm focusing on improving my JavaScript skills, with HTML, CSS, SCSS and PHP already under my belt.  
I'm also exploring the basics of UI/UX design and enjoy making things that are not just functional but user-friendly.

I’m open to collaboration and happy to contribute to projects by taking care of smaller or routine tasks — learning and improving along the way 💪  
Let’s grow together!
