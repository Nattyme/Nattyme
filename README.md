Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Natasha.
#
I study web dev. I know a bit of HTML, CSS, SCSS and PHP.
#
Currently I fight with JavaScript. It wins for now, but it's not gonna be too long. I hope so ...:)
#
Feel free to share some tasks with me as your teammate. I'm able to support you by doing some routine. I'll do my best ðŸ’ª
#
See u!
